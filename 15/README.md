# AdventOfCode: Day#15

Description: https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/15

## Usage

```
go run .
```

## Solution

Due to laziness, the input is hardcoded to the main function (instead of accepting it as a parameter to the CLI). Also, I only used integration level tests and it lead me to have a single function that does everything, thankfully the problem domain was not large
